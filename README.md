# ðŸš¦ VicCrashAnalytics â€“ Predicting Blackspot Risk in Victoria

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project is part of a consulting assignment for the **Victorian Department of Transport (DOT)**, conducted by **VicCrashAnalytics**, a fictitious data consulting firm. The objective is to analyze factors contributing to **blackspots (accident hotspots)** and predict accident risk using **machine learning**.

## ðŸ”¹ Project Scope  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on accident-prone areas and demographics.  
- **Regression Modeling** on **Blackspot.csv** (labeled dataset) to predict accident risk.  
- **Deploying the Model** on **Blackspot_Competition.csv** (unlabeled dataset) for evaluation.  
- **Feature Engineering & Model Optimization** to improve predictive performance.  

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Provided  
- **Blackspot.csv** â€“ Contains labeled data on accident blackspots.  
- **Metadata.csv** â€“ Describes dataset features.  
- **Blackspot_Competition.csv** â€“ Unlabeled dataset for model deployment & competition.  

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Machine Learning** (Regression & Classification Models)  
- **PyCharm** (Development Environment)  
- **GitHub** (Version Control)  

## ðŸ“ˆ Goal  
Deliver **data-driven insights** to support road safety campaigns, legislative reforms, and infrastructure improvements.
